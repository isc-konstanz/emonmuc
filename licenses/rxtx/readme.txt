RXTX - Java library for serial communication

Beware there exist several different versions of rxtxcomm-2.2pre2. The
version of RXTX in this folder was taken from Linux Mint 15
(2.2pre2-11) and has many bug fixes compared to the latest version on
the website. The version vom Linux Mint was converted to a bundle
using bnd: java -jar bnd/bnd-1.50.0.jar wrap RXTXcomm-2.2pre2.jar
